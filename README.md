# Robyn

Robyn is a natural language interface to database (NLIDB) system with medical health as its domain of knowledge. Robyn was written as a part of my senior capstone research for my undergrad. The end goal is a web application which is similar to a chatbot that can answer your questions related to medical health in addition having a normal human-like conversation with you.

There are 4 main tools used in this project.
* AIML is used to handle the natural language processing and handle the user's queries.
* SQLite3 is used as the database server.
* Python is used to put the AIMl and SQLite3 together and work with the queries as well.
* Bottle is used as the web framework to host Robyn.
