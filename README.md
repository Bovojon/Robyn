# Robyn

Robyn is a natural language interface to database (NLIDB) system with medical health as its domain of knowledge. Robyn was written as a part of my senior capstone research for my undergrad. The end goal is a web application which is similar to a chatbot that can answer your questions related to medical health in addition having a normal human-like conversation with you.
