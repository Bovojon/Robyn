# Robyn

Robyn is a natural language interface to database (NLIDB) system with medical health as its domain of knowledge. Robyn was written as a part of my senior capstone research for my undergrad. Robyn is a web application, similar to a standrad chatbot in design, that can answer your questions related to medical health in addition having a normal human-like conversation with you. 

There are 5 main tools used in this project.
* AIML is used to handle the natural language processing and handle the user's queries.
* SQLite3 is used as the database server.
* Python is used to put the AIMl and SQLite3 together and work with the queries as well.
* HTML/CSS/JS are used to design the web interface for Robyn.
* Bottle is used as the web framework to host Robyn.

As of now, Robyn can answer various questions about diseases. **My final research paper has been included in the repository as well**. If you want more background information about Robyn, that is a great place to start.
